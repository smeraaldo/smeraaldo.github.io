# **20 Most Popular Programming Languages ​​According to the _TIOBE Index_.** 

_The TIOBE Programming Community Index_ is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated _once a month_. The ratings are based on the number of qualified engineers worldwide, courses, and third-party providers. Popular websites _Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing, and over 20 others_ are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE Index is not about the best programming language or the language in which the most lines of code are written. The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about which programming language to adopt when starting to build a new software system. 

There are also images, short descriptions, and links to documentation for each language:
